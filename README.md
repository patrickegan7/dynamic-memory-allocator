# dynamic-memory-allocator

This was a project from a class called Machine Organization & Programming (CS354) where I implemented functions to allocate and free heap memory. I only worked on the functions called Mem_Alloc and Mem_Free, the rest of the code was provided by my professor. I took this class during the Spring 2018 semester.
